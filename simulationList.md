# A List of Possible Simulations

## The following list gives an idea about how simulations have been created
## based on different parameter valeus.

## parameters:
N(v): The number of validators.
Er:   An error rate.
R:    A ratio between the number of dishonest and honest validators.
T(h): A time for honest validatators to vote.
T(d): A time for dishonest validators to vote.
Tl:   Time latency.
