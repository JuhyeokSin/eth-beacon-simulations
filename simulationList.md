# A List of Possible Simulations

## The following list gives an idea about how simulations have been created, based on different parameter valeus.

## parameters:
1. N(v): The number of validators.
2. Er:   An error rate.
3. R:    A ratio between the number of dishonest and honest validators.
4. T(h): A time for honest validatators to vote.
5. T(d): A time for dishonest validators to vote.
6. Tl:   Time latency.
