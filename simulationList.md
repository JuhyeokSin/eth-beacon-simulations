# A List of Possible Simulations

## The following list gives idea about how simulations have been created
## based on different parameters

## parameters:
N(v): The number of validators
Er:   An error rate
R:    A ratio between the number of dishonest and honest validators
T(h): A time for honest validatators to vote
T(d): A time for dishonest validators to vote
Tl:   Time latency
